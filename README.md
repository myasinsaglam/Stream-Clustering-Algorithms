<h2> Python Implementations of Stream Clustering Algorithms and Additional Developments </h2>


<h3> EvoStream </h3>
Evolutional Stream Clustering Algorithm Python Implementation 

<h4> v1 - Base version </h4> 

[[Paper]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214579618300649)  [[Code]](https://github.com/MatthiasCarnein/evoStream_C.git)

<h4> v2 - Additional developments and algorithm improvements added by me </h4>

It will be added soon.


<h3> Documentation of Algorithms</h3>

Doxygen preferred to generate docs. After documented the code with epytext format. Just follow instructions below: 

1- Install doxygen
```shell script
 sudo apt-get install doxygen
```

2- Install Doxypypy 
```shell script
pip3 install doxypypy
```

3- Update doxygen configuration file and run:

```shell script
doxygen config.dox
```
